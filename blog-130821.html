<h1>A day of Clojure</h1>

<p>With support from my employer (a great one, Citerus AB), I spent my 
workday today emerged into the world of Clojure code. I am a total newbie 
to the Clojure language and syntax, but I have read about the concepts 
and about how it was created... By one smart guy, on his own to start with. 
No design by committee. Rich Hickey created Clojure and released it 
open source. Thank you!</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>The official download from clojure.org contains the clojure jar
file which can be used to run a Clojure REPL (read-eval-print-loop).
Like this:</p>

<code>java -cp /a/pr/clojure-1.5.1/clojure-1.5.1.jar clojure.main</code>

<p>Works OK on my computer, but a major annoyance was that arrow-up 
key did not bring back previous commands. Otherwise it worked fine. 
My ordinary text editor, jEdit, does support Clojure syntax which is helpful.
</p>

<p>For the very first taste of Clojure, I recommend the online 
REPL at tryclj.com, Type "next" to start on a 5-minute code-based tutorial.</p>

<p>I also used the Eclipse plugin: http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/ 
- seems nice. Code completion, useful syntax highlighing and help with 
parentheses matching.</p>

<h2>First impression</h2>

<p>I actually don't mind the syntax! That is <i>not</i> something I would have said 
yesterday, or something I expected I would say today. But it actually makes 
sense. So incredibly simple, and yet so powerful. For mathematical expressions 
the prefix notation used by Clojure gets a bit hairy though. 
Who wants to see:</p>

<pre>    (def c (Math/sqrt (+ (* a a) (* b b))))     ; Clojure
</pre>

<p>Most would prefer:</p>

<pre>    c = Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b);                   ; Java
</pre>

<p>which is more inline with standard mathematical notation.
But, often the syntax is not bad at all, actually. It is so very simple;
basically just a list of lists. This simplicity also allows for easy, 
pre-runtime modification of the code using macros. Clojure like all Lisp
languages have support for code-as-data.</p>

<p>Of course, Clojure shines compare to Java, when it comes to support
for functional type of programming. One simple example: code to time the
execution of a function call. In Clojure, it can be done like this:</p>

<pre>
    (defn time-it [f]
      (def t (System/nanoTime))
      (f)
      (* 1e-9 (- (System/nanoTime) t))
    )
    
    (defn my-main []
      (println (time-it #(Thread/sleep 1000)))
</pre>

<p>With Java, somewhat equivalent code looks like this:</p>

<pre>
  public class A {
    public static double timeIt(Runnable r) {
      long t = System.nanoTime();
      r.run();
      return 1e-9 * (System.nanoTime() - t);
    }
        
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      double time = timeIt(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
          try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
          } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
          }
        }
      });
      System.out.println(time);
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>Bear in mind that the <code>time-it</code> function works for any 
Clojure function while Java's <code>timeIf</code> method only works for
a Runnable.</p>

<h2>Concurrency</h2>

<p>Clojure has fantastic features when it comes to concurrency control.
Things that are really hard to handle in Java, but are solved in an 
elegant way in Clojure. Clojure supports state changes using 
software transactional memory 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">STM</a>) 
methods and persistent data structures.
The STM approach is essential; we really need support for it in Java too.
Concurrency without it is just really too complex to handle; we have enough 
bugs to deal with in single-threaded applications.
See <a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org/60second.html">Multiverse</a>.</p>

<p>The approach of Clojure with STM and persistant data structures 
is similar conceptually to my approach with the database
<a href="http://bergdb.com/">BergDB</a>. It also uses STM and persistent
data structures for high-performance concurrency.</p>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The prefix notation is not as bad as it may seem at first.</li>
<li>I like Clojure and would like to learn more.</li>
<li>I would not hesitate to use it together with Java in a commercial project.
  The integration between Java and Clojure seems simple, performant and stable.</li>
<li>If one is used to Java and need better support for functional programming
  and that is all that is needed, I would probably go with Scala.</li>
<li>If code-as-data is needed, or excellent handling of concurrency, Clojure is
  probably a good option.</li>
<li>I wonder about performance, would be interesting to test. If the performance
  is not good enough, the great support for concurrency has less significance.
  A single-threaded java code could possibly beat the same stuff running on 
  8 cores in Clojure - I don't know.</li>
<li>I wonder when someone will write a similar language (STM, persistent data structures, 
  functional, code-as-data) but a typed language and with infix notation (Java/C-like).
  I am afraid the Clojure syntax might scare many programmers away from 
  a very interesting and powerful programming language.</li>
</ul>
